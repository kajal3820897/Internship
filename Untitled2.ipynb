It doesn't matter how fast or how far. It doesn't matter if today is your first day or if you've been running for twenty years. There is no test to pass, no license to earn, no membership card to get. You just run.\", \"The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.\", 'The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.', \"About all you can do in life is be who you are.

The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.\", 'Curiosity is one of the most permanent and certain characteristics of a vigorous intellect.', 'Leaders must be close enough to relate to others, but far enough ahead to motivate them.', 'Regret for the things we did can be tempered by time; it is regret for the things we did not do that is inconsolable.', 'America... just a nation of two hundred million used car salesmen with all the money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the world who tries to make us uncomfortable.', 'For every disciplined effort there is a multiple reward.', \"The spiritual journey is individual, highly personal. It can't be organized or regulated. It isn't true that everyone should follow one path. Listen to your own truth.\", 'The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled.']\n"
